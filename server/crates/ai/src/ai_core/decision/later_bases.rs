//!
//! Base 3 is taken once the natural is finished and the army can spare it: five Tanks in all,
//! three of them not committed to a push, no enemy inside the base, and the Depot's cost in the
//! bank. After that, each base whose first oil well runs dry unlocks exactly one more base, under
//! the same conditions. A lost base is retaken, after a cooldown, because the target does not
//! shrink.
//!
//! While a base is being taken, two guard Tanks leave the attack pool and hold a post in front
//! of the new site, and new Tanks and Riflemen rally there. The Depot is ordered once the guards
//! arrive, or after a bounded wait if the site is quiet, so a base is never stalled indefinitely.
//! Guards are not replaced: losing one before the foundation is down means the site is
//! contested, so it is abandoned for a while instead of feeding Tanks into it one at a time.
//! The guards keep covering the finished Depot for a while before rejoining the army.
